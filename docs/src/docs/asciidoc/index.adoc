== About RrTools

RrTools is a program to keep track of you model railroad cars.
It focuses on cars (though locomotives are not excluded).
If can exchange information with JMRI Operations -- cars be exported from
JMRI and inported into RrTools (and
_vice versa_).
If you have equipped your cars with RFID chips and have an RFID reader,
RrTools can make it easier to select existing cars and enter new cars.
Keep track of cars needing maintenance and perform regular inspections using RrTools.

== Starting RrTools

=== Starting
[WARNING]
You must use Java 1.8 to run RRTools. The program uses JavaFX and this is not
included in the current Java.
It is possible to run with Java 11, but the JavaFX module must be
separately downloaded and correctly linked.

Use "Java -version" to make sure you are running the correct version of Java.
Run the program entering:

 java -jar rrtools-1.0.2.jar

If this is the first time you have run the program, it will take you to
a "Preferences" page.

=== The First Time

The first time you run the program, you must enter some required information
(primarily the name and location for the database).
If the database information is not present, the Preferences page will be
opened.
After you enter the requested information and click on "Done", the program will end.
When the program next starts, you will be viewing the main page.

=== After the first time

== The RR Tools Page

=== About this Page

==== The Page Elements

image::basic_screen.png[]

1. The list of cars
2. Drop down list for view selection
3. Message area (Status line)

Across the top are the usual Menu items.
The far right of the menu contains elements that allow you to select
a subset of the cars, based on individual characteristics.
The body of a the page contains a table of your railroad cars,
with a heading describing the columns.
If you have not yet entered any cars, the body will show "No Content in Table."

There is a status line at the bottom of the page.

=== Column Headings

==== About the Columns
The columns are quite flexible.
Click on the Column Heading to sort by that column.
A second click will sort in Descending Order (an arrow by the column name
will show the direction of the sort).
An additional click will undo the sort.
Drag the divider left or right to make the column larger or smaller.
Drag the entire column to a new position.

When you change the column characteristics, the columns will revert to
the standard position and size the next time you start the program.

==== Column Contents

The body of the list shows the Reporting Mark, Car Number, Car Type and AAR Type of each car. \
Reporting Mark and Car Number are required for every car.
Car Type is optional (but highly recomended).
AAR Type is also optional

=== Entering New Cars

If you have an RFID Reader attached, it is simply a matter of bringing the car's RFID tag
within range of the reader.
When a new tag is detected (a tag number that does not exist in the database),
the New Car page is shown.
If the tag has been before, the car with that tag is selected (if the car is
shown in the current view, otherwise the status line will show the tag).
If you want to enter a new car without a tag, select "Edit/Create New" from the menu.

== The New Car/Edit Car Page

image::new_Car_window.png[]

* Car ID database number of the current car.
It will be empty if this is a new car. (It is not editable).
* Reporting Mark is required (The "Save Changes" button will not
be enabled until a  Reporting Mark and Car Number are entered).
Click on the Drop-Down arrow to see the contents of the current list.
If the Reporting Mark you need is not shown in the list,
type the new reporting mark in the entry area.
* Tag Number is the RFID tag number that was read.
It will be empty if no tag was read.
It is not editable.
(The only ways to add a tag to a car are either to read from an RFID Reader,
or import a car with an RFID tag).
* Car Number is the second required field.
Though it shows as car "number", it is a text field and allows you to enter any text you
desire (though it probably should be a number).
* Car Type is a drop down list.
Select the matching car type from the list.
If the car type is not shown, you will need to use "Maintain/Maintain Car Type" to
add a new car Type (or use "Maintain/Import Table Data/Import Car Types" to import
a CSV file with new car types).
* AAR Type is another drop-down list.
Again use either Maintain/Maintain AAR Type or Maintain/Import Table Data/Import AAR Types
to add additional types.
* PRR Type -- again a drop down list. The Pennsylvania Railroad had its own version of
car type which denoted both the design series and the the type.
If you don't want to use this field, feel free to ignore it.
* Type of Coupler. If you use Sargent couplers, there is a drop-down for those
(as well as Kadee).
If you don't use Sargent couplers, use the Maintain menu to update the list of coupler types.
* Type of Kit. A drop-down list let you track whether this is a Ready-to-Run,
"Shake-the-box", Craftsman, or scratchbuilt.
* Length of Car (in scale feet).
Update preferences, or select "Meters" if you want to use the Metric units. The length is
needed to calculate the correct NMRA car weight.
The length will also be used if you choose to export cars to JMRI Operations.
* Weight of car, in either ounces, or, by selecting grams from the next drop-down (or electing
Metric Units on the Preferences page).
* Color of car. The car color will help in identifying the car, and is also exported to
JMRI Operations.
* Resistance wheels - check this box if the car is equipped with resistors for detection
purposes.
* Weathered? - check this box if the car has been weathered.
* Manufacturer - the manufacturer of the car, or kit.
Add the manufacturer here if you don't find it in the drop-down.
* Date Purchased - enter, or choose the date the car or kit was purchased.
* Date Placed in Service - enter or choose the date the car began service on your railroad.
* Purchase Price - enter the price of the car or kit if you want to track that information.
* Purchased From - choose, or enter a new vendor from whom you purchased this car or kit.
* Date Kit Built - enter or pick the date that construction of the kit was completed.
Ignore this field if this a Ready to run car.
* Built Date - enter the month and year stenciled on the car. This field is useful for
tracking the era to which the car belongs.
* Description - enter a basic description of the car.

When you have completed entering all the desired information, click on the "Save Changes" button.
This button will be enabled after you have entered both the Reporting Mark and the
car Number.
If you change your mind and want to revert without saving any data, click on the
"Cancel Changes" button.


== The Preferences Page

image::Preferences_page.png[]

This page will be shown when you first run the program, or whenever the database information
is invalid. There are defaults for many field, except for the database information.
The program will *not* run if the database information is not present (and valid).
When you enter, or change, the database information and click on "Prefs Done", the program will
exit. The new information will be used when you restart the program.

=== The Fields

* Com Port - a drop-down list of available com ports on your system. If you have an RFID reader
attached, select the COM port to which the reader is attached.
This list is built when the program starts and will not change if you attach and/or detach
a reader.
The format of the name of the port is operating system dependent.
If you don't have or don't want to use an RFID reader, you may ignore this field.
The status line will show that you don't have a reader connected.
* Unit System - select whether you want to use English units (feet and ounces), or Metric units
(Meters and Grams).
* Scale ratio - select your scale.
* Inspection Every - How frequently do you want to inspect your cars.
Enter the number of months or years between inspections (use 99 years if you don't want to
reinspect cars).

=== Database Information
Changing the following information will force the program to exit after completion.

The Database may be an internal database (built by the program, will software contained
within the program), or it may be an external database. Currently only DB2 is supported as
an external database.
If you use an external database, enter the URL for the database and choose the URL button.
Otherwise, choose the location and name of the database and the URL will be created.

* Database Username - enter the username associated with this database. If this is a
new database, the user information will be created based on what you enter.
* Database Password - the password is obscured but not encrypted. It will be saved with
the preferences information.
* Preferences Location - The directory containing the database.
This *MUST* be a fully qualified location - a relative location is not supported.
The name from the "Database Name" field will be appended, along with other information,
to form the complete URL.

Click on "Prefs Done" to save the information. If the database information was changed,
the program will exit. Restart the program to use the new infomation.

== Import/Export Cars

This choice allows you to import and export the Cars to and from JMRI Operations.
For Export, choose the name and location for the file to be created.
A CSV file will be created in the format required for JMRI Operations Import.
Similarly, once a file has been created by JMRI Operations Export, do a "File/Import"
and choose that file.
